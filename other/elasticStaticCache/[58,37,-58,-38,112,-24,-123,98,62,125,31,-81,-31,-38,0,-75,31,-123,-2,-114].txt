characteristics greatly affect the degree of runoff versus infiltration clay content reduces infiltration, especially after the ground is saturated with water (which swells the clay) sandy soil or friable loams, both of which have low clay content, have higher rates of infiltration more densely compacted soils have lower rates of infiltration note: rainfall can actually compact soil rainfalling directly on soil also tends to plug the opening in the ground with fines from near the surface (like espresso grind coffee in a melitta filter) waterlogged soil has a lower rate of infiltration than dry soil frozen soil has almost no infiltration (it may actually be coated with ice thus the timing and dynamics of a storm event can have a great influence on the proportion of runoff generally speaking, longer or repeated rains result in more runoff human development of an area usually has a dramatic effect on increasing runoff paving and roofs have essentially no infiltration one of the engineering calculations that must be done when planning a development is the excess flood flow--this must be taken into account diverted stormwater may have substantially poorer quality than native runoff (metals and oils etc from the streets and yards) commercial and industrial establishments that discharge stormwater at a point are now subject to the restrictions of categorical wastewater discharge permit Effects of vegetation vegetation can greatly increase the rate of infiltration hold water in place, buffer the release of water to the groundsurface shield the soil surface from some of the effects of compaction by rainfall clear cutting a forest can increase runoff and erosion disastrously, as can overgrazing and improper cropping proper management reduces the effects in fact, well conducted forestry (including some clear cutting) can increase the amount of snowmelt which is available for human use without dangerously increasing erosion plowing along hillside contours (conservation tillage) tends to slowdown runoff and thus decrease erosion and increase infiltration bare soil is bad Erosion and rivers water flow in streams is often turbulent (ie, not laminar or in smooth lines parallel to the stream bed) different flow velocities will lift particles of different sizes generally, smaller particles will be lifted by lower velocities but, clay and silt (&lt;0.06 mm) can be harder to erode can be tightly packed (consolidated) may not stick up into the flow enough suspended matter abrades rocks etc as the river cuts a \nstream channel, the some material is dissolved by surface water passing over it the process of erosion gives rise to stream beds a drainage pattern develops like the veins on a leaf (assuming the surface is uniformly erodable-irregularities change the pattern (trellis or rectangular) the entire area from which a river and its tributaries draw runoff is called a drainage basin or watershed the divisions between drainage basins are ridges called topographic divides these can be drawn on topo maps by always drawing at right angles to the contours a fast young stream cuts rapidly and sharply into the rock (V-shaped cross section) these narrow valleyed rivers have waterfalls and rapids caused by sudden drops in elevation along the stream bed may be caused by erosion (Niagara) or glaciation (Yosemite) slope wash and mass movement (collapse) of the valley walls tend to flatten the walls of the valley a more mature river cuts more laterally, increasing the number and size of side canyons deposits some eroded material in the base of the valley alternatively, the valley itself can be broadly eroded to form a plain an old river has a broad floodplain at the base of the valley, the channel of the river can meander across it the periodic flooding of the river enriches the floodplain with nutrients carried by the swollen river the bed of the river can actually sit above the surrounding floodplain, with the stream channel separated by natural levees the low-lying flood plains are also popular for housing, which can be a problem in the rainy season building dikes can make the problem worse downstream the base flow of a river is fed by springs in a rain storm flow increases, the more widespread a storm is (over the drainage basin) the more flow increases the plot of flow of a river is called the hydrograph Flood protection planning based on the 100 year (or other) flood flood control or management measures: reducing peak flows dams land use controls early warning systems insurance (often from Uncle Sam) Lakes Stratification the slow moving water of lakes is not necessarily mixed by turbulence, thus there is an opportunity for layers to form cool water sinks, warm rises in summer (if the lake is deep enough), the lake separates into the warm epilimnion and the cool hypolimnion the two layers are separated by a thermocline you have felt this with your toes when swimming sometimes you can pick it up with a fishfinder the hypolimnion is isolated from the surface, ie oxygen thus the bottom of the lake can become anoxic due to aerobic decomposition this condition is deadly to fish the anaerobic environment favors reduction reactions sulfide can form solubility of metals and nutrients is affected in winter, the stratification is slightly different with ice and cold water on top and water at 4 C on the bottom if photosynthesis stops due to snow and ice cover, there can be anoxia under the ice in spring and fall, lakes turnover important in the seasonal changes in the lake ecosystem have affects on the distribution and movement of nutrients and metals Groundwater infiltrating water sinks through the permeable substrate until it reaches impermeable material (bedrock or clay) underground, essentially everywhere, there is a layer of permeable soil or rock saturated with water this groundwater is more than 98% of the freshwater on earth such a layer is called an aquifer water table or unconfined artesian or confined flow of water in an aquifer is determined by the permeability (ft/day) and porosity (percent) of the substrate material and the hydraulic head or gradient that the water is under water is drawn for human use from aquifers by wells if water is drawn faster than it can be replenished the aquifer can be depleted (so-called mining of water) subsidence saltwater intrusion (can be counteracted with wastewater injection) groundwater not withdrawn by humans eventually emerges at springs (or underwater discharge zones in streams) where it rejoins runoff to the oceans Limestone &amp; Sinkholes groundwater can \"erode\" soluble rocks like limestone (calcium carbonate) an underground chamber so eroded is called a cavern the ground above such erosion can collapse and form a sinkhole the underground channels in a limestone area can contribute to rapid underground spread of pollutants groundwater movement is difficult to model in Karst areas (as it is in ordinary fractured rock) Glaciers when more snow falls in the winter than melts in the summer, the level of snow rises when the wet of snow and ice gets great enough, they start to flow (very slowly) as a glacier the river of ice has its own erosional characteristics huge boulders and massive quantities of lighter material are carried along when they melt or recede they leave behind fields full of boulders and sandy morraines (like Long Island or Cape Cod) the polar glaciers seem to extend toward the equator in some sort of cycle (peaking at the
