life-spans. Certain nerve cells exist for as long as the individual itself. Other kinds of cells, such as neutrophils and intestinal cells in vertebrates, turn over rapidly. Even individual cells of a particular type may survive for different lengths of time depending on other events. For example, mammalian T lymphocytes are formed in the thymus. Within the thymus, 95 percent of such cells die rapidly, within two or three days of their formation, unless they are selected by the thymus because of a particular specificity of their receptor for antigen. Successfully selected cells are released by the thymes and migrate to other parts of the body, where they become part of the large pool of T lymphocytes in the animal, responsible for fighting off infections. Even there, these cells have a relatively short half-life- less than a week-unless they encounter an antigen to which their receptors can bind. If this happens, the T lymphocyte divides and produces various hormonelike factors (lymphokines), which stimulate the B cells (antibody-producing cells) to divide and help rid the animal of the invading antigen. Once the invader is destroyed some of Be progeny of the once-dividing T lymphocyte become \"memory cells\"; they stop dividing and producing lymphokines, but they survive in He animal more or less indefinitely, with a life-span approximately that of the individual itself. By this means the immune system builds up a pool of long-lived T lymphocytes, which are useful in fighting off the types of infections that its host will encounter during life. A single encounter with an antigen, and burst of cell division, changes the life expectancy of the human T cell, without any further cell division, from less than a week to more than 10 years. SPECIAL PROBLEMS IN PLANT DEVELOPMENT Plants and Animals Share Many Structures and Developmental Mechanisms, But There Are Some Major Differences The fast and most obvious difference between plant and animal development is that plant development is usually repetitive in nature and indefinitely long. A tip of a maple twig will put out pairs of leaves all season long and then again the following year. Roots are less periodic in structure, but they too grow and branch indefinitely. The plant body is basically the accumulation of the products of its past developmental activity. Many of the cells remain alive. By design, however, many do not, resulting in the accumulation of wood and bark. Occupying ever more volume and intercepting ever more light is obviously a key strategy of high adaptive significance for plants. This strategy is generally implemented by having the tip regions elongate in length indefinitely, a process called primary growth. Subterminal regions stop elongating and, in perennials, increase in girth at their periphery, while producing dead but functional wood cells toward the interior of the stem or root.

The model includes the two fundamental processes of virtually any living multicellular organisms, that is, the consumption of resources for somatic growth and the investment of resources into offspring production. In unitary organisms, which grow to maturity by multiplying cells based on mitosis, resources are invested into somatic growth until reaching a certain body size, after which sexual reproduction is initiated by the activation of cells in the germline ( Stearns, 1992 ; Hughes, 1989 ). Remarkably, resources are then invested into the production of offspring genetically different from the parents, by the processes of meiosis and fusion with genetically different gametes (outcrossing). This change in resource investment from clonal growth during ontogenesis to offspring produced sexually after reaching maturity characterizes the life cycle of unitary organisms, that is, most metazoan animals ( Stearns, 1992 ; Begon et al., 2005 ), but why this switching occurs remains unclear and presents the essence of the enigma of the maintenance of sexual reproduction. Our model for the first time includes both of these fundamental processes of virtually all living multicellular organisms. It focuses on large and long-lived metazoan animals, such as vertebrates, which reproduce several times per lifetime, that is, are iteroparous. The model therefore combines theories on life-history evolution with theories on the maintenance of sexual reproduction. Combining these two bodies of theories and basing both of them on the consumption of resources as the main driving force was possible by building on our previous work. In 2007, we presented a model on the maintenance of sexual reproduction in organisms characterized by intermittent mixis, that is, organisms that reproduce asexually except once per season when resources become limiting ( Scheu & Drossel, 2007 ). This model ignored that allocating resources to somatic growth fundamentally changes life-history characteristics and the fitness of organisms. Focusing on these changes, we presented a model on the evolution of life histories based on metabolic theory and explicit resource-consumer dynamics (Y. Song, S. Scheu & B. Drossel, under review). The unifying approach taken in the present model is based on the assumption that both somatic growth during ontogenesis and the production of offspring by sexual reproduction are driven by resource availability as the most important factor determining growth, survival and the mode of reproduction ( Ghiselin, 1974 ; Williams, 1975 ; Bell, 1982, 1988 ).",1.2620564699172974],["Overview of normal growth and development throughout the life span.",1.2591056823730469],["Growth and Development Through the Life Span 4.",1.2591056823730469],["a community that stresses growth and development across the life span.",1.2591056823730469],["Human growth and development throughout the life span.",1.2591056823730469],["Demonstrates knowledge of the principles of life span, growth and development.",1.2591056823730469],["human growth and development throughout the life span;",1.2591056823730469],["the relationship of growth and development to behavior through the life span.",1.2591056823730469],["Human growth and development throughout the life span.",1.2591056823730469],["Human Growth and Development: A Life-Span Approach.",1.2591056823730469],["Overview of normal growth and development throughout the life span.",1.2591056823730469],["Demonstrates knowledge of the principles of life span, growth and development.",1.2591056823730469],["the relationship of growth and development to behavior through the life span.",1.2591056823730469],["the relationship of growth and development to behavior through the life span.",1.2591056823730469],["ANALYZE HUMAN GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN.",1.2591056823730469],["Growth and Development Through the Life Span 4.",1.2591056823730469],["EDPS 325 Life Span Human Growth and Development.",1.2591056823730469],["c.

Within a few days, this sphere embeds itself in the wall of the uterus, where the placenta nourishes the embryo by allowing the transfer of substances between the blood of the mother and that of the developing child. During the first three months of pregnancy, successive generations of cells organize into organs; during the second three months, all organs and body features develop; and during the last three months, further development and growth occur. These patterns of human development are similar to those of other animals with backbones, although the time scale may be very different.",1.2330471277236938],["Developmental biology investigations will study the influence of gravity and microgravity on animal growth, development, reproduction, genetic integrity, life span, senescence, and subsequent generations of animals.",1.2251486778259277],["The Developmental Biology program will study the influence of gravity and microgravity on animal growth, development, reproduction, genetic integrity, life span, senescence, and subsequent generations of animals.",1.2251486778259277],["Lab-12 (2/99) TNSG 114 Growth And Development: Life Span - 3 credits Study of human growth and development through all stages of life.",1.2246698141098022],["Recent research reminds us of the crucial importance of the first three years of life, during which the vast majority of brain growth and development occurs.",1.2228468656539917],["SS PSY 210 Life-Span Development 5 (55/0) Prerequisite: PSY 101 Examines the physical, intellectual, emotional, and social growth and development that occurs throughout the human life-span.",1.2218217849731445]]
