DRAFT April 10, 2014 177 Lesson 4. Wind’s Temperature Wind Speed and Wind Direction Duration : 4 days Background Information Measuring and Recording Speed and Direction of the wind Weathermen gather information about the speed and direction of the wind. They do this to predict weather. They use instruments to measure the speed and direction of the wind. Wind speed is measured by an anemometer. The wind speed is shown by the number of circles or revolutions the anemometer makes in one minute. At times the anemometer almost does not move. We say that the wind is calm. A slow wind will move the anemometer a little. A moderate wind can turn the cups of the anemometer. At times the anemometer can make several circles or revolutions. We say that the wind is strong or fast. Some anemometers have a device that measures the speed of the wind. This can be used to name the wind. The wind vane is an instrument with an arrowhead and a tail. The wind pushes the tail. The arrowhead points toward the direction from which the wind comes. Winds are always described according to the direction from which they are blowing. As the wind strikes the tail of the wind vane, the wind vane turns so that the arrow points in the directions from which the wind is blowing Name Speed (km/hr) Calm 0-1 Light Air 1-5 Light Breeze 6-11 Gentle Breeze 12-19 Moderate Breeze 20-28",2.1389834880828857],["Students will use weather instruments to measure change in temperature, humidity, air pressure, precipitation, wind speed and direction.",2.1317298412323],["Students will use weather instruments to measure change in temperature, humidity, air pressure, precipitation, wind speed and direction.",2.1317298412323],["Students will use weather instruments to measure change in temperature, humidity, air pressure, precipitation, wind speed and direction.",2.1317298412323],["Students will use weather instruments to measure change in temperature, humidity, air pressure, precipitation, wind speed and direction.",2.1317298412323],["Students will use weather instruments to measure change in temperature, humidity, air pressure, precipitation, wind speed and direction.",2.1317298412323],["Students will use weather instruments to measure change in temperature, humidity, air pressure, precipitation, wind speed and direction.",2.1317298412323],["Students will gather and organize weather data using instruments and computer technology (temperature, air pressure, precipitation, wind direction and speed).",2.1317298412323],["Use the Brunton weather guide to determine the wind speed, air temperature and barometric pressure.",2.1317298412323],["Students will use weather instruments to measure change in temperature, humidity, air pressure, precipitation, wind speed and direction.",2.1317298412323],["Use the Brunton weather guide to determine the wind speed, air temperature and barometric pressure.",2.1317298412323],["Students will use weather instruments to measure change in temperature, humidity, air pressure, precipitation, wind speed and direction.",2.1317298412323],["Students will use weather instruments to measure change in temperature, humidity, air pressure, precipitation, wind speed and direction.",2.1317298412323],["We will also practice with weather station instruments used to determine barometric pressure, wind speed, air temperature and cloud types.",2.1317298412323],["Students will use weather instruments to measure change in temperature, humidity, air pressure, precipitation, wind speed and direction.",2.1317298412323],["Describe changes in weather using measurable quantities, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind direction and speed.",2.1316864490509033],["Describe changes in weather using measurable quantities, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind direction and speed.",2.1316864490509033],["Of course, the weather problem uses one vector equation and four scalar equations which describe the wind velocity, air temperature, air density, air pressure, and moisture content.",2.1237869262695312],["Of course, the weather problem uses one vector equation and four scalar equations which describe the wind velocity, air temperature, air density, air pressure, and moisture content.",2.1237869262695312],["Weather Calculator Collection of tools which can be used to convert weather variables including temperature, moisture, pressure and wind speed.",2.113819122314453],["Weather Calculator Collection of tools which can be used to convert weather variables including temperature, moisture, pressure and wind speed.",2.113819122314453],["Observation of these short term variations in air pressure, and their relationships to temperature, rainfall and wind speed and direction can all be added to your store of knowledge of local weather, and give your barometer greater usefulness as a forecasting tool.",2.0880048274993896],["Observation of these short term variations in air pressure, and their relationships to temperature, rainfall and wind speed and direction can all be added to your store of knowledge of local weather, and give your barometer greater usefulness as a forecasting tool.",2.0880048274993896],["Robin Hood's Wind &quot;Robin Hood's wind&quot;

WEATHER TERMS TERM/PHRASE CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION Absolute Humidity is a weather element which indicates the actual amount of water vapor in a unit volume of air Adiabatic Changes is a general term which indicates changes in temperature with no heat energy being added or lost Air Mass is a large body of air which has the same condition of moisture and temperature throughout its horizontal levels Anemometer is a weather instrument which measures the speed of wind Anticyclone is a mass of circulating air which moves outward from a high-pressure area Cold Front is a air mass movement in which a mass of cold air advances into territory occupied by warm air Condensation is cooled water vapor which changes from an invisible gas to liquid water;",1.7120438814163208],["WEATHER DATA COLLECTION:
