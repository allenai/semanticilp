outer 400-600 km of the Moon to melt as the melt crystallized, dense particles sank to the bottom, while low density particles floated to the top this low density material cooled to form a crust of high albedo anorthosite at the surface of the Moon continued bombardment from the last stages of lunar accretion and from passing asteroids and comets created the rugged surface Impact Craters cratering is a major geological process not recognized for a long time because on the Earth we have erosion, where wind and water over long periods of time smooth out the surface, erasing evidence of impact craters on the Moon , have no atmosphere, no wind, no water, so almost no erosion but earliest lunar craters were not recognized because they are so big and because they were filled in by lava flows now we recognize that craters range in size from microscopic to basin-sized , depending on the size of the impactor Cratering Processes much of what we understand about cratering processes is learned from experiments for simplification, cratering is usually divided into three distinct stages, but in actuality, many parts of the stages overlap and occur concurrently Compression Stage initial contact between impactor (traveling up to 20 km/s) and target sets up a shock wave contact energy produces high velocity jetting impactor continues to push into the target pressure is so high that target rock and impactor are pulverized Excavation Stage shock wave causes material to move radially away from point of impact weakening of shock wave away from source causes material flow to curve upwards and away, ejecting material above the surface in the shape of an inverted cone flow of material away from impact forms a crater cavity when shock wave can no longer eject material beyond crater rim, ejecta cone begins to fall to the surface with the bottom of the cone (the last material to be ejected) falling out first, near the crater rim, and the top of the cone (the first material to be ejected) falling out last, furthest from the crater Modification Stage once crater cavity stops growing, shock wave no longer supports the cavity and gravity takes over for small craters, shock wave not strong enough to form gravitationally unstable cavities, so little modification occurs for large craters, shock wave pressures form a cavity that collapses under gravity and so larger craters will have modification features such as slump blocks , terraces, central peaks , central rings and basin rings Crater Dating on Earth, can use radiometric dating (decay of radioactive isotopes) to measure the ages of rocks on Moon (and other planets) don't always have access to rocks from area you need to date, so need other methods of age dating craters can be used to determine relative ages of planetary surfaces old surfaces, that have been exposed to cratering processes for long periods of time, are more heavily cratered than young surfaces, which have experienced relatively little cratering highlands are older than maria large basins tend to be the oldest impact structures, since they obliterate older craters or cover them up with basin ejecta confirmed by radiometric dating of
