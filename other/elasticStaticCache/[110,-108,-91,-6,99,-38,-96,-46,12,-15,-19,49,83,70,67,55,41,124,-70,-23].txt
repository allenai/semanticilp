In the metric system, chemical engineers once used the kilogram-mole (noted kg-mol), which is defined as the number of entities in 12 kg of 12-C, and often referred to the mole as the gram-mole (noted g-mol), when dealing with laboratory data. However modern chemical engineering practice is to use the kilomole (kmol), which is identical to the kilogram-mole, but whose name and symbol adopt the SI convention for standard multiples of metric units.",1.5902891159057617],["Mass Gram (g) and Kilogram (kg) should be used.",1.587416172027588],["Units of measure: kilogram, gram, liter, degrees Fahrenheit, degrees Celsius Measurement tools: balances, spring scales, measuring cups or graduated cylinders, thermometers, metric ruler Common substances such as those listed in objective 1 above Hot and cold substances, such as ice, snow, cold water, hot water, steam, cold air, hot air, etc. PME 9) Describe when length, mass, weight, area, or volume are appropriate to describe the size of an object or the amount of substance.",1.5868953466415405],["The basic units of the metric system are the liter, used to measure volume, the meter, used to measure distance, the gram, used to measure mass, and degrees Celsius, used to measure temperature.",1.5768969058990479],["On the other hand , mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object , and it is typically described in grams .",1.571302890777588],["No provision contained in or made under this or any other Act prevents the use of “gram” or “gramme” as alternative ways of spelling that unit, and the same applies for other units in the metric system which are compounds of “gram”.",1.563169002532959],["No provision contained in or made under this or any other Act prevents the use of “gram” or “gramme” as alternative ways of spelling that unit, and the same applies for other units in the metric system which are compounds of “gram”.",1.563169002532959],["Hey Mr. Science Writer, such as you are: A gram (and thus a kilogram) is a unit of mass, not weight.
