Another example: deer respond to the presence of a predator by running away, or joining together in groups (herds) - these are changes to its behaviour that decrease its chances of getting eaten. Physical adaptations to not getting eaten would be having highly developed leg muscles for quick acceleration and running away, or maybe camouflage colouration, or confusing colouration (such as the stripes on zebras, which make it hard to see one individual from another when they are in a group)",0.9456943273544312],["Causes of changes in languages, war and migration.",0.9433943033218384],["For example, increased pigmentation may change susceptibility to visual predators, and vertical migration may alter the food and predator regimes to which organisms are exposed.",0.9433151483535767],["Most animals exhibit cycles in reproductive activity, usually related to changing seasons.",0.9426562786102295],["Most animals exhibit cycles in reproductive activity, usually related to changing seasons.",0.9426562786102295],["Migration  occurs when a group of animals move from one region to another, and then return to their original region at a later time (geese).

[52] A first extinction event in the beginning of the Cenomanian eliminated two of the three icthyosaur feeding guilds then present, the 'soft-prey specialists' and the 'generalists', leaving only an apex predator group, which probably was not particularly specialized. [52] The second major ichthyosaur extinction took place during the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event , an ' anoxic event ', eliminating the apex predators, [52] after which just a single lineage survived, Platypterygius hercynicus, which disappeared shortly afterwards, about 93 million years ago. [53] Ichthyosaur extinction was thus a pair of abrupt events rather than a long decline, probably related to the environmental upheavals and climatic changes in the Cenomanian and Turonian . [52] [54] If so, it was not caused by mosasaurid competition; large mosasaurs did not appear until 3 million years after the ichthyosaur extinction, likely to fill the resulting ecological void. [52] Plesiosaurian Polycotylidae perhaps also filled some of the niches previously occupied by ichthyosaurs, although they had coexisted for 19 million years. The extinction was most likely the result of ecological change and volatility that caused changes in migration, food availability, and birthing grounds. This part of the Cretaceous was one in which many other marine extinctions occurred, including those of some types of microplankton, ammonites, belemnites and reef building bivalves.

These proximal cues serve as indicators for various ultimate factors, such as changes in season, which can affect the abundance of pests, predators, and forage. Although the costs of migration can be great, benefits often include increased individual survival rates and increased reproductive fitness. One of the best-studied cases of cervid migration is that of barren-ground caribou , which travel an annual distance of more than 500 km. Unfortunately, seasonal migration is cued by photoperiod while onset of plant-growing season is cued by temperature. If the growing season of species-specific resources is not precisely matched to the initiation of migration, changes in plant phenologies may detrimentally impact the long-term survival of migratory animals. For example, increasing mean spring temperatures in West Greenland appear to have resulted in a mismatch between caribou migratory cues and the onset of spring growing season for important forage plants. Evidence suggests that caribou migrations are not advancing at a comparable rate with forage plants and as a result, calf production in West Greenland caribou has decreased by a factor of four.
