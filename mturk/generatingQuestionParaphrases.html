                    <h3>Generating Sentence Paraphrases</h3>
                    <p>In what follows, we give you a <b>question</b>, its <b>answer</b>, and a <b>sentence</b> that supports it. Here is an example: 

                        <div class='boxedBig'>
                            <b> Question: </b> How many times does Earth rotate on its axis in one day? 
                            <br>
                            <b> Answer: </b> once
                            <br>
                            <b> Sentence: </b> Earth rotate once on its axis, in one day.
                        </div>

                        When we say the <b>sentence</b> supports the <b>question</b>, we mean, the <b>answer</b> to the <b>question</b> is inferable from the <b>sentence</b> only. 
                        <br>

                        We ask you to paraphrase the given sentence so that the sentence still supports the question (i.e. you can infer the question from the sentence).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Here are a few examples for demonstration: 
                    <div class='boxedBig'>
                        <b> Question: </b> How many times does Earth rotate on its axis in one day? 
                        <br>
                        <b> Answer: </b> once
                        <br>
                        <b> Sentence: </b> Earth rotate once on its axis, in one day.
                        <br> <br> 
                        Here are example paraphrases supposed to be generated by you: 
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                          <li><b>Sentence Paraphrase 1: </b> One day is the amount of time that it takes for the Earth to rotate once on its axis.  </li>
                          <li><b>Sentence Paraphrase 2: </b> Most people think that the period of time it takes Earth to rotate once on its axis is what we call one day. </li>
                          <li><b>Sentence Paraphrase 3: </b> From the point of view of the Sun the Earth takes 24 hours to complete one rotation. </li>
                          <li><b>Sentence Paraphrase 4: </b> The Earth also rotates, or spins, on its axis. It takes one day to spin around itself one complete time. </li>
                          <li><b>Sentence Paraphrase 5: </b> Rotation is when a planet or moon turns all the way around or spins on its axis one time. On Earth, a rotation is pretty short - it happens once a day! </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <br><br>
                    This is another example: 
                    <div class='boxedBig'> 
                        <b> Question: </b> Which of the following processes is responsible for changing liquid water into water vapor?  
                        <br>
                        <b> Answer: </b> evaporation 
                        <br>
                        <b> Sentence: </b> Evaporation processes is responsible for changing liquid water into water vapor. 
                        <br> <br> 
                        Here are example paraphrases supposed to be generated by you: 
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                          <li><b>Sentence Paraphrase 1: </b> The change of phase from liquid to gas is called vaporization or evaporation. </li>
                          <li><b>Sentence Paraphrase 2: </b> Boiling will change all water being boiled fairly quickly into water vapor. Exposed water of any temperature will slowly become water vapor by way of evaporation. </li>
                          <li><b>Sentence Paraphrase 3: </b> When liquid water changes into water vapor it is called evaporation. Condensation would be the opposite from water vapor to liquid water. </li>
                          <li><b>Sentence Paraphrase 4: </b> Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas or vapor. Evaporation is the primary pathway that water moves from the liquid state back into the water cycle as atmospheric water vapor. </li>
                          <li><b>Sentence Paraphrase 5: </b> Evaporation occurs when liquid water turns into a water vapor.  </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <br><br>
                    As it can be seen, there are different phenomena in our paraphrasing process. Take this senstence for example: 
                    <div class='boxedBig'> 
                        <b>Original Sentence:</b> The employee received the letter from the secretary. 
                    </div>    
                    Here are a bunch  of transormation we can apply to change this text, without changing much about its meaning: 
                    <div class='boxedBig'> 
                        <ul>
                          <li><b> Lexical change: </b> </li> The secretary delivered the message to the employee.  (letter → message)
                          <li><b> Predictate direction change: </b> </li> The secretary delivered the letter to the employee.  (X send Y → X deliver Y )
                          <li><b> Passive to active, or vice versa: </b> </li> The letter was sent to the employee by the secretary.
                          <li><b> Co-reference substitution: </b> </li> The employee was on time at work. He received the letter from the secretary. 
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    This list is by no means an exhaustive one. You have full freedon in creating your paraphrases and you don't have to follow any of these patterns. This is just to give you a little sense of what kind of transformations exist can be created. 
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>


    For the questione below, generate paraphrases of the sentence, as explained above: 

    <div class="row" id="workContent">
        <div id="userInputBox">
            <div class='boxedBig'>
                <b>Question: </b> ${QUESTION1} <br>
                <b>Answer: </b> ${ANS1} <br>
                <b>Sentence: </b> ${SEN1} <br><br><br>
                <b>Sentence Paraphrase 1 </b><input type='text' class='form-control' name="P1" required> <br>
                <b>Sentence Paraphrase 2 </b><input type='text' class='form-control' name="P2" required> <br>
                <b>Sentence Paraphrase 3 </b><input type='text' class='form-control' name="P3" required> <br>
                <b>Sentence Paraphrase 4 </b><input type='text' class='form-control' name="P4" required> <br>
                <b>Sentence Paraphrase 5 </b><input type='text' class='form-control' name="P5" required> 
            </div>
        </div>
        <input type='text' class='form-control' id='hiddenQuestion' name='hiddenName'>
        <br><br><br>
    </div>
